# INTRODUCTION

For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a Spark DataFrame from a csv file. The DataFrame housed various data points related to home sales including # of bathrooms, # of bathrooms, price and square footage.

Ran spark queries leveraging the round and aggregator functions. Some of the queries included using where clauses and AND operators to retrieve the correct data.

  - Query that returns the average price, rounded to two decimal places, for a four-bedroom house that was sold in each year.

  - Query that returns the average price, rounded to two decimal places, of a home that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms.
